TODO and ideas list:
* have the help use the same code as ls does
* add an options command (display width, lines to show, etc)
* maybe a few additons so it'd be useful for programming? dunno
	- at the absolute least, maybe autoindent?
	- writing Python with ezpyle is awful and it doesn't have to be
	- or code in general, but Python is the worst affected
* some kind of tab width config
* some way to clear the screen
	- even if it's just like, spewing a bunch of blank lines
	- there'd really be a way to configure how to clear/how much to clear
	- like, I doubt this will be used on an actual real TTY, but...
	- seriously, it gets really messy
* set up the parser to read in any passed arguments
	- this is really easy, just split on space
	- and we just check [0], and if [1] exists, use that, etc, etc
	- half tempted to not do this, I've typed commands on the wrong prompt
	- only accepting specifics has been a real life-saver
* autoindent
	- literally just look at the last line's indentation and copy it
	- maybe add a command to indent/unindent a line
	- also, ezpyle should probably replace tabs with spaces during display
	- at the very least, make that configurable
